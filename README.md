# UK Traffic Accident Data Visualization

An interactive data visualization dashboard that explores traffic accident patterns across the United Kingdom from 2005 to 2007. This project transforms raw accident data into meaningful visual insights, enabling users to understand spatial and temporal patterns of road accidents.

## Overview

This visualization provides a comprehensive view of UK traffic accidents through multiple coordinated visualizations:

- **Interactive Geographic Map**: Displays the spatial distribution of accidents across the UK, with each point representing an accident location. Accidents are color-coded by severity level (High, Medium, Low) for quick visual analysis.

- **Dynamic Bar Chart**: Shows the distribution of casualties across different days of the week, revealing patterns in accident frequency and severity throughout the weekly cycle.

- **Pie Chart Visualization**: Illustrates the number of vehicles involved in accidents, segmented by day of the week, helping identify peak risk periods.

## Features

### Interactive Exploration
- **Year Selection**: Toggle between 2005, 2006, and 2007 to compare accident patterns across different years
- **Hover Details**: Mouse over any accident point to view detailed information including:
  - Precise longitude and latitude coordinates
  - Accident severity rating
  - Number of vehicles involved
  - Number of casualties
  - Date, day of week, and time of incident

### Visual Filtering
- **Severity Legend**: Interactive legend allows users to filter accidents by severity level
- **Zoom & Pan**: Navigate the UK map to examine specific regions in detail
- **Smooth Transitions**: Animated transitions between years provide seamless data exploration

### Data Insights
The visualization enables users to:
- Identify accident hotspots across different regions
- Discover weekly patterns in accident occurrence
- Compare year-over-year trends in traffic safety
- Understand the relationship between day of week and accident frequency
